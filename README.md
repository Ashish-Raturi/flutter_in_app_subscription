Adding in-app subscription to a Flutter app requires correctly setting up the App and Play stores, verifying the purchase, and granting the necessary permissions, such as subscription perks.

In this course, you'll add an in-app subscription to an app (provided for you) and verify these purchases using a backend Firebase service.

The backend service (also provided for you) verifies that the purchases are made in Firebase using Cloud Functions and Firestore. These Firebase products are used to make the process easier, and in your production app, you can use this backend service.
